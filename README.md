# CatPaw

Tinder for cats and more!

## Getting Started

Hello there, this app is an example of using SwiftUI in pair with Codable. Also, this app uses TheCatAPI for fetch cats data, CoreData for cashing loaded cat photos and breeds, CoreML for recognizing cat on the photo, and a few tricks.
You can free use any example of code in this project. If it was helpful or interesting for you please write to me on my [Mail](romanmishchenko34@icloud.com).

### Warnings Info

* [TableView] Warning once only: UITableView was told to layout its visible cells and other contents without being in the view hierarchy (the table view or one of its superviews has not been added to a window).

So, it happens cause I used SwiftUI and UITabBarController. Hope Apple provide some issue to fix this problem. But this problem never come to fatal Errors in the application (fortunately), but it can use additional perform (In my case not).

* [LayoutConstraints] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints. Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want.

I think it a very funny warning, cause Apple doesn't fix it more than year.
