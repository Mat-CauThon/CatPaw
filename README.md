## Getting Started

Hello there, this app made with love!

### Warnings Info

-[TableView] Warning once only: UITableView was told to layout its visible cells and other contents without being in the view hierarchy (the table view or one of its superviews has not been added to a window).

So, it happens cause I used SwiftUI and UITabBarController. Hope Apple provide some issue to fix it a problem. But this problem never come to fatal Errors in the application.

-[LayoutConstraints] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints. Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want.

I think it a very funny warning, cause Apple doesn't fix it more than year.
